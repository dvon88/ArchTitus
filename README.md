This is a fork of ArchTitus by ChrisTitusTech (subscribe to his channel and support) that is aimed at Salesforce development. Auto-installed packages from the original were modified to remove unnecessary packages and add in VSCode (not OSS code as that does not natively support the MS Marketplace extensions where SF extensions live), Google Chrom and Firefox (Brave does not always play well with SF in my experience), JDK11 (required for SF development), SFDX CLI (obviously), x11-ssh-askpass (I repeatedly had issues with ssh-askpass not working, so git wouldn't work. Installed this and it works, just asks for ssh password, nbd) and others are coming as I improve on the script

# ArchTitus Installer Script

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/YiNMnan.png" />

This README contains the steps I do to install and configure a fully-functional Arch Linux installation containing a desktop environment, all the support packages (network, bluetooth, audio, printers, etc.), along with all my preferred applications and utilities. The shell scripts in this repo allow the entire process to be automated.)

## Create Arch ISO or Use Image

Download ArchISO from <https://archlinux.org/download/> and put on a USB drive with [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/), [Ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net/en/index.html), or [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/en/)

If you don't want to build using this script I did create an image @ <https://www.christitus.com/arch-titus>

## Boot Arch ISO

From initial Prompt type the following commands:

```
pacman -Sy git
git clone https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/ArchTitus
cd ArchTitus
./archtitus.sh
```

### System Description
This is completely automated arch install of the KDE desktop environment on arch using all the packages I use on a daily basis. 

## Troubleshooting

__[Arch Linux Installation Guide](https://github.com/rickellis/Arch-Linux-Install-Guide)__

### No Wifi

#1: Run `iwctl`

#2: Run `device list`, and find your device name.

#3: Run `station [device name] scan`

#4: Run `station [device name] get-networks`

#5: Find your network, and run `station [device name] connect [network name]`, enter your password and run `exit`. You can test if you have internet connection by running `ping google.com`.
